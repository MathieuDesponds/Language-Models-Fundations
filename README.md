#  Assignment 1 - Language model foundations ðŸ’¬

## Assignment Description

- In the first two parts of this assignment, you need to train and evaluate two different language models; an **LSTM-based model** and a **Transformer-based model**. You will first explore the distribution of the input data and perform data cleaning and pre-processing. Then you will build two language model training and testing pipelines implementing an LSTM and a Transformer language model. You will play around with different hyperparameters.
- In the third part, you will build models on the downstream task of **Sentence Paraphrasing**. More specifically, you will fine-tune a sequence-2-sequence (**Encoder-Decoder**) architecture with attention and you will also fine-tune a **Transformer** model for this task.
- Finally, you will fill out a report with the model results for the different parts.
